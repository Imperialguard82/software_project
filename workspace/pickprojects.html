                <p>Title:
                Automatic Temporal Updates in Articles <br></p>
                <p>Proposal: <br></p>
                 <p>News articles will often refer to last week or today, or some more complicated variant reference to prior, current, or future, events. <br>
                 This project would automatically update annotated temporal references with the time the reader is viewing the article,<br> 
                 for example if the event occurred 1 week ago an article written 2 weeks prior would be updated to reflect the passage of time and the fact that the event covered has happened already.<br> 
                 This will increase the readability and give quick indications as to the relevance of the article.</p>

                <p>Title:
                FYP Allocation Tool <br></p>
                <p>Proposal: <br></p>
                 <p>This project calls for the development of a web-based portal wherein NCI academics can upload project ideas for viewing by students.<br> 
                 The students would then be able to select a set of projects (in order of preference) which they would like to undertake. <br>
                 There would then be an automated allocation process which would allocate the projects. This allocation should endeavor to make as many people happy as possible. <br></p>

                <p>Title:
                Technology to Improve Mental Health <br></p>
                <p>Proposal: <br></p>
                 <p>This project targets the highly important area of mental health with a view to using the technology which is becoming ubiquitous in our lives to assist those with mental health issues through simple lifestyle interventions. <br>
                 This work could be based around implementing an App to encourage one or more of the ``little things that make a big difference to how we feel'' as identified and advertised in the recent Irish government campaign </p>
